# [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) Dissertation Template for the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu)

[**Source**](https://github.com/leafac/latex-dissertation-template-for-the-johns-hopkins-university)

This is a LaTeX template that conforms to the [Formatting Requirements](https://www.library.jhu.edu/library-services/electronic-theses-dissertations/formatting-requirements/) given by the Johns Hopkins University Library.

**Disclaimer:** This template is here to help but offers no guarantees. You’re still responsible for ensuring that your dissertation conforms to the requirements.

## Compiling

Run [`latexmk`](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk):

```
$ latexmk
```

The generated PDF will be at [`dissertation.pdf`](dissertation.pdf).

## Contents

<details>
<summary><code>dissertation.tex</code>: Main Document</summary>

```latex
\documentclass[12pt, oneside]{book}
```

The `book` document class conforms to most of the formatting requirements and is one of the default document classes included in LaTeX.

The `12pt` option increases the font size of body text from the default `10pt`. This is optional, since the formatting guidelines would allow for `10pt`, but it has the effect of reducing line length which makes the document [more comfortable to read](https://practicaltypography.com/line-length.html).

The `oneside` option makes the margins the same in all pages, instead of the default behavior which is to account for binding and make the bigger margin alternate from left on odd pages to right on even pages.

In this file we include information about the citations. The existing content is just an example of an entry. For more on managing a bibliography, refer to the [BibTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex) documentation. Or use a citation manager such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) or [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io), which produce a `.bib` file.

In this file we configure the metadata associated with the PDF (see the discussion about PDF/A in the section about `dissertation.tex` above). You may inspect some of the metadata using Preview in macOS by going to **Tools > Show Inspector**:

<p align="center">
<img alt="Metadata in Preview" src="docs/metadata.png" width="366" />

<summary><code>.latexmkrc</code>: <code>latexmk</code> Configuration</summary>

```
$pdf_mode = 1;
```

Configure [`latexmk`](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk) to produce a PDF using the [`pdflatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/pdftex) executable, instead of the default which is to produce a DVI using the `latex` executable.

The [Johns Hopkins University Library](https://www.library.jhu.edu/library-services/electronic-theses-dissertations/formatting-requirements/) mentions [this other LaTeX template](https://github.com/jrclayton/jhu-dissertation-mwe). What makes our template different is that it’s small and comes with [line-by-line explanations](#contents).
