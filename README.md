The [Johns Hopkins University Library](https://www.library.jhu.edu/library-services/electronic-theses-dissertations/formatting-requirements/) mentions [a template by John “Randy” Clayton](https://github.com/jrclayton/jhu-dissertation-mwe). There’s a whole lineage of templates of that sort. What makes this template different is that it’s very small and comes with line-by-line explanations.
